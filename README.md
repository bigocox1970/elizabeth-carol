# Welcome to your Lovable project
# Elizabeth Carol Website

This is the website for Elizabeth Carol, a psychic medium and spiritual guide. The website includes features for building an email list, managing a blog with comments, and collecting customer reviews.

## Features

- Email newsletter subscription
- Blog with commenting functionality
- Customer reviews and testimonials
- User authentication system
- User profile management
- Admin panel for managing all content
- **AI Blog Post Generation** - Generate blog posts using OpenAI's GPT-3.5

### AI Blog Post Generation

The admin panel now includes an AI-powered blog post generator that allows Elizabeth to:

- Enter a topic or brief outline
- Generate a complete blog post in her authentic 77-year-old British voice
- **Automatically generate a beautiful spiritual image** to accompany the post
- Edit and customise both the content and image before publishing
- Save time while maintaining quality and personal touch

The AI is specifically trained to write as Elizabeth Carol would - a wise, 77-year-old clairvoyant with proper British English grammar and expressions. Generated posts include:
- Compelling titles (British English)
- Brief excerpts for previews (British English)
- Full blog content (800-1200 words, British English throughout)
- Practical spiritual advice drawn from decades of experience
- Personal, slightly formal but warm tone befitting her age and wisdom
- **Beautiful, calming spiritual images** created with DALL-E 3

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables need to be set in the Netlify dashboard:

```
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
EMAIL_USER=your_email_user
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_admin_password
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

To set these variables in Netlify:
1. Go to the Netlify dashboard
2. Navigate to Site settings > Build & deploy > Environment variables
3. Add each variable with its corresponding value

### Setting up OpenAI API Key

To enable the AI blog post and image generation feature:

1. Create an account at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Generate an API key from your OpenAI dashboard
3. Add the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable with your API key
4. The AI feature will use GPT-3.5-turbo for blog content and DALL-E 3 for image generation

**Note**: The AI generation feature requires the OpenAI API key to be configured. Without it, the feature will show an error message to configure the API key. The same API key is used for both text generation (blog posts) and image generation.
