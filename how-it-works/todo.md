as of 20/06/25 we need to finish the paypal integration

there is a problem with the calender view and the day view not in sync

maybe change back to no calander and book buttons going to the contact page?? ask mum??

i deallly mum would be able to turn on and off the online booking system so that all book buttons go to the contact paee instead of the book page. then mum could send them an invoice after speaking with them and manually booking the reading from her andmin page. this way the calender is not displayed.
