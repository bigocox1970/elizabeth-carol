Prompt:



Write a blog post in the voice of a 77-year-old clairvoyant who speaks with quiet authority, grounded wisdom, and spiritual clarity. Avoid clichés and overly sentimental phrases. The tone should be reflective, calm, and sincere—no need for elaborate titles or biographical details. The writing should feel personal but not preachy, poetic without being flowery. Keep the language simple, spacious, and resonant, as if guiding the reader gently inward. Avoid calling the reader “dear one” or referring to them directly with excessive familiarity. Focus instead on insight, inner stillness, and lived experience. The writing should feel like a private reflection shared from a place of knowing, rather than a performance.



You can adjust the theme or subject by adding a line like:



The topic is [gratitude / stillness / inner guidance / divine masculine / spiritual resilience / etc.]



Would you like me to format this into a reusable template for you?
